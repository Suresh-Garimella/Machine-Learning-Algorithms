1. Find the correlation between ‘survived’ (target column) and ‘sex’ column for the Titanic use case in class.

 Do you think we should keep this feature?
 Yes , we should keep this feature.

Correlation is a statistical term which in common usage refers to how close two variables are to having a linear relationship with each other.
And Features with high correlation are more linearly dependent and hence have almost the same effect on the dependent variable. So, when two features have high correlation, we can drop one of the two features. correlation values are b/w -1 to +1.
Justification:- The Correlation value for the features "Survived" and "Sex" is -0.543351380657755.
But in our senario the correlation is inversely proportional between two features are not completely correlated to each other.
which means each one has their fair share in predicting the output from the machinelearning model.
